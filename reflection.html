                    WEB222 introduced me to world of HTML,CSS and javascript. I had never tried these languages before and honestly, this 
                    course has really taught me a great stuff. The best thing about this course is that it is very well designed. Each Assignment
                    was based on the stuff done in previous weeks. Most importanty, all assignments were open-book. I used to surf Internet trying 
                    and practicing different codes. Some worked some didn't. But I really enjoyed it.Completing each
                    assignment felt like I leveled up in terms of my knowledge, creativity and enthusiasm.<br/><br/>
                    Regards<br/>

                    <h2>What is responsive Design?</h2>
                    <p>Responsive design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design approach used to create content 
                        that adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes. Designers size elements in relative units (%) 
                        and apply media queries, so their designs can automatically adapt to the browser space to ensure 
                        content consistency across devices.</p>

                    <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies....?</h2>
                    <p>Responsive design is a way of developing web properties so 
                    that the device they are used on determines the way that the site will be displayed.
                    In the early days of the internet a website had to work on a monitor. As long as it performed reasonably well
                     on a laptop screen it would work on every other PC to a reasonable extent. Then mobile computing arrived and things 
                     changed. Devices today range from those with tiny screens (like a smartphone) right through to huge monitors. The user
                      experience needs to be catered for on each of these and that’s where responsive design comes in. </p>
                    <p>The need for this approach is being driven by the understanding that more and more people are accessing the mobile web
                        and in many markets now – smartphone access to the net is much greater than traditional PC access. Mobile devices offer 
                        different capabilities to desktop/laptop environments too, such as touchscreens, GPS data, accelerometers, etc.</p>
